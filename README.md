#  Title of the project: Eyes

## Description of the project:

 This project is an Exercise on a cursor tracking set of eyes. It was a mostly 
 straight forward. Converting from one eye to two eyes on the page 

## How to Use:
  No secrets here, just move your cursor around the page.

## Roadmap of future improvements: 
  If I were to attempt changing the project I would consider having both eyes 
track the cursor even when it's centered between the eyes. It would require 
individual tracking.
